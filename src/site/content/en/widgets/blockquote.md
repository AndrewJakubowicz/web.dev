## Challenge

Building great mobile experiences is an indispensable part of Alibaba.com’s
success. The mobile web is their primary platform for discovery on mobile, so
they’ve always focused on design and functionality. They found it difficult
to build an engaging experience for the mobile web, however. They looked at
the mobile web as a platform to shift non-app users to the app, but many
preferred to stay within a browser.

of browsing directly from their mobile browser

As a web developer, **learning the internals of browser operations helps you make better decisions and know the justifications behind development best practices**. While this is a rather lengthy document, we recommend you spend some time digging in; we guarantee you'll be glad you did.
