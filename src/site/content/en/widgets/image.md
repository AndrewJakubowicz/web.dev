## Building a Galaxy

My plan was to procedurally generate a model of the galaxy that can put the star data in context -- and hopefully give an awesome view of our place in the Milky Way.

To generate the Milky Way, I spawned 100,000 particles and placed them in a spiral by emulating the way galactic arms are formed. I wasn't too worried about the specifics of spiral arm formation because this would be a representational model rather than a mathematical one. However I did try to get the number of spiral arms more or less correct, and spinning in the "right direction."

In later versions of the Milky Way model I de-emphasized the use of particles in favor of a planar image of a galaxy to accompany the particles, hopefully giving it a more of a photographic appearance. The [actual image is of spiral galaxy NGC 1232](http://www.eso.org/public/images/ngc1232b/) roughly 70 million light years away from us, image-manipulated to look like the Milky Way.

### Finding your frame

Once you've located the correct row in the tracing tool for your game, the next step is to find the main loop. The main loop looks like a repeating pattern in the tracing data. You can navigate the tracing data by using the W, A, S, D keys: A and D to move left or right (back and forth in time) and W and S to zoom in and out on the data. You would expect your main loop to be a pattern that repeats every 16 milliseconds if your game is running at 60Hz.

Once you've located your game's heartbeat, you can dig into what exactly your code is doing at each frame. Use W, A, S, D to zoom in until you can read the text in the function boxes.

Success: Try to maintain 60fps for all of your animations. That way, your users won't see stuttering animations that interfere with their experience. Ensure that any animating element has `will-change` set for anything you plan to change well ahead of the animation starting. For view transitions, itâ€™s highly likely you will want to use `will-change: transform`.

## Use translations to move between views

<figure class="float-left">
{% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/ZbdixE36RlDboM08jwGH.gif", alt="Translating between two views.", width="320", height="404" %}
</figure>

To make life easier, assume that there are two views: a list view and a details view. As the user taps a list item inside the list view, the details view slides in, and the list view slides out.

<figure class="float-right">

</figure>

To achieve this effect, you need a container for both views that has `overflow: hidden` set on it. That way, the two views can both be inside the container side-by-side without showing any horizontal scrollbars, and each view can slide side-to-side inside the container as needed.
