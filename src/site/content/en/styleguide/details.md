[Try to build a form](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/c7d89671f738240187a86cda1074d554) where users can submit their favorite color.
The data should be sent as a `POST` request, and the URL where the data will be processed should be `/color`.

{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary 'h3' %} Show form {% endDetailsSummary %}
One possible solution is using this form:

```html
<form method="post" action="/color">
    <label for="color">What is your favorite color?</label>
    <input type="text" name="color" id="color">
    <button>Save</button>
</form>
```

{% endDetails %}

Say you want a script running at `https://web.dev`
to process the form dataâ€”how would you do that?
[Try it out](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/fbf90faccc7a22e208c2a507f33be598?editors=1100)!

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary 'h3' %} Toggle answer {% endDetailsSummary %}

You can select the location of the script by using the `action` attribute.

```html
<form action="https://example.com/animals">
...
</form>
```

{% endDetails %}
